Decorators

- Functions are first class objects (can be passed around and used as arguments)
- Functions can be created with inner functions 
- This is basically what a decorator is and does

- decorators wrap a function, allowing you to modify its behavior without modifying the function itself
- Can wrap it using first way but second looks better (syntactic sugar)

Some Uses:
- Add logging
- Test performance
- Caching
- Can validate data (permissions)
- Can transform data
